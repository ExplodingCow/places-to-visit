<p>Kuala Lumpur, officially the <strong>Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur</strong>, or commonly <em>KL</em>, is the <strong>national capital of Malaysia</strong> as well as its largest city. The only global city in Malaysia, it covers an area of 243 km2 (94 sq mi) and has an estimated population of 1.73 million as of 2016.[7] Greater Kuala Lumpur, also known as the <em>Klang Valley</em>, is an urban agglomeration of 7.25 million people as of 2017.

<p>Kuala Lumpur is the <strong>cultural, financial and economic centre of Malaysia</strong> and home to the Parliament of Malaysia, and the official residence of the <em>Malaysian King (Yang di-Pertuan Agong)</em>, the Istana Negara. The city once held the headquarters of the executive and judicial branches of the federal government as well, but they were moved to <strong>Putrajaya</strong> in early 1999. Some sections of the judiciary still remain in Kuala Lumpur.
